Hello! Thanks for downloading Unvanquished.

To run the game, extract the engine archive for your operating system
into this subdirectory, so the files are right outside the pkg/ directory.
Then, run the executable extracted from the archive.

Engine archives are named like <system>-<architecture>.zip

System is either, linux, windows, or macos.

Architecture is either:

- amd64: 64-bit x86 processor
- i686: 32-bit x86 processor
- arm64: 64-bit arm processor
- armhf: 32-bit arm processor with hardware float

For example windows-amd64.zip is the engine archive for running
the game on the Windows operating system for 64-bit x86 computers.

Executable name for each operating system:

- Linux: daemon
- Windows: daemon.exe
- macOS: Unvanquished.app

Happy Fragging :)
