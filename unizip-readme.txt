Hello! Thanks for downloading Unvanquished.

To run the game, extract the engine archive for your operating system
into this subdirectory, so the files are right outside the pkg/ directory.
Then, run the executable extracted from the archive.

NOTE: In Windows Explorer and many Linux file browsers, using the
"Extract all" function creates an unwanted extra directory, so it is better
to put the archive's files into this directory using copy and paste.

Engine archives are named like <system>-<architecture>.zip

System is either, linux, windows, or macos.

Architecture is either:

- amd64: 64-bit x86 processor
- i686: 32-bit x86 processor
- arm64: 64-bit arm processor
- armhf: 32-bit arm processor with hardware float

For example windows-amd64.zip is the engine archive for running
the game on the Windows operating system for 64-bit x86 computers.

Executable name for each operating system:

- Linux: daemon
- Windows: daemon.exe
- macOS: Unvanquished.app

Happy Fragging :)
