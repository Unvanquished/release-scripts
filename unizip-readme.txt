Hello!

Thanks for downloading Unvanquished. To run the game, extract the archive for your OS into this
subdirectory, so the files are right outside the pkg/ directory. Then, run the executable extracted
from the archive. See below for the executable name for each OS.

Executable for each OS:
	OSX: Unvanquished.app
	Linux x86_64: daemon
	Windows: daemon.exe

Happy Fragging :)
