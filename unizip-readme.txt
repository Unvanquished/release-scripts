Hello! Thanks for downloading Unvanquished.

To run the game, extract the engine archive for your operating system
into this subdirectory, so the files are right outside the pkg/ directory.
Then, run the executable extracted from the archive.

NOTE: In Windows Explorer and many Linux file browsers, using the
"Extract all" function creates an unwanted extra directory, so it is better
to put the archive's files into this directory using copy and paste.

Archive for each operating system:
	Linux, 64-bit x86 (a.k.a. x86-64; most common):     linux-amd64.zip
	Linux, 32-bit x86 (very old computers):             linux-i686.zip
	Linux, 64-bit ARM (a.k.a. AArch64):                 linux-arm64.zip
	Linux, 32-bit ARM with hardware float:              linux-armhf.zip
	Linux, 32-bit ARM with soft float (armel):          not supported
	Windows, 64-bit (a.k.a x64):                        windows-amd64.zip
	Windows, 32-bit (some low-end computers):           windows-i686.zip
	MacOS (either Intel or Apple Silicon):              macos-amd64.zip

Executable name for each operating system:
	Linux:      daemon
	Windows:    daemon.exe
	macOS:      Unvanquished.app

Happy Fragging :)
